# Notes
- I need to style the app.  I attempted to use foundations and had it working but then it started to affect other elements of the site which caused them to break.  I had to decide to focus on the tecnical aspects of the site or learn foundations.  I choose to continue working on the technical aspects of learning Rails and will focus on foundations with my personal website.  I need about 10 more hours on this to ship but it's getting there.
